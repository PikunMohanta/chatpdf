    "History of Coprocessor\n3\nCoprocessors for floating-point arithmetic first appeared in desktop computers in the 1970s and \nbecame common throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Early 8-bit and 16-bit processors \nused software to carry out floating-point arithmetic operations. Where a coprocessor was \nsupported, floating-point calculations could be carried out many times faster. Math coprocessors \nwere popular purchases for users of computer-aided design(CAD) software and scientific and",

    "Properties of Coprocessor\n▸Without a primary microprocessor, the coprocessor cannot function.\n▸Main processor has to identify and segregate computationally intensive instructions \nin a program.\n▸The instructions which have an intensive amount of calculations are performed by a \ncoprocessor.\n▸The main processor handles all other activities.\n5",
    "Advantages\n▸Save register usage\n▸Fetch data immediately when it is ready at WB stage\n▸Easy coprocessor task generation; basic block grouping\n▸Full control of instruction synthesis\n▸Maximize parallelism; address calculations are also \nperformed\n▸Memory I/O task given to base processor\n▸No branch calculations\n6",
    "Disadvantages\n▸The disadvantage (besides just materials cost) is that you will have to figure \nout how to power it, mount it, and interface with it.\n▸It’s a significant step up in the complexity of your control system and \nintroduces new potential points of failure.\n▸Many co-processors don’t like being turned off suddenly, require \nconfiguration to start your program at boot, can’t take a ton of vibration, etc.\n7",
    "Architecture\n▸The coprocessor interface and the Arm Custom Instructions features, both use the \nconcept of a coprocessor ID value. The instruction set architecture uses a bitfield (4-\nbit) to define which coprocessor is accessed, meaning, in theory, that there could be \nup to 16 coprocessors attached to a processor.
